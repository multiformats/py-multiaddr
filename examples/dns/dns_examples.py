DNS resolution examples for py-multiaddr.

This script demonstrates how to use DNS resolution functionality in py-multiaddr,
showing how to resolve bootstrap node addresses like those used in js-libp2p.

## Overview

This script shows various examples of DNS resolution using py-multiaddr:

1. **Basic DNS Resolution**: Simple resolution of DNS addresses to IP addresses
2. **Bootstrap Node Resolution**: Resolving real bootstrap node addresses with peer IDs
3. **DNS Protocol Comparison**: Testing different DNS protocols (/dns/, /dns4/, /dns6/, /dnsaddr/)
4. **Peer ID Preservation**: Ensuring peer IDs are maintained during resolution
5. **Sequential Resolution**: Processing multiple addresses sequentially
6. **py-libp2p Integration**: Example of how to use resolved addresses with py-libp2p

## Expected Output

When you run this script, you should see output similar to:

```
DNS Resolution Examples
==================================================
=== Basic DNS Resolution ===
Original address: /dns/example.com
Protocols: ['dns']
Resolved to 12 addresses:
  1. /ip4/23.192.228.84
  2. /ip4/23.215.0.136
  ... (more IPv4 and IPv6 addresses)

=== Bootstrap Node Resolution ===
Resolving: /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
  Peer ID: QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
  Resolved to 6 addresses:

    1. /ip4/23.215.0.136
    2. /ip4/23.215.0.138
    ... (6 IPv4 + 6 IPv6 addresses)

=== Peer ID Preservation Test ===
Original address: /dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
Original peer ID: QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN

=== py-libp2p Integration Example ===
Processing bootstrap node: QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN
  Resolved: 139.178.91.71:4001 (peer: QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN)

Resolved 1 bootstrap peers:
  QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN -> 139.178.91.71:4001

==================================================
All examples completed!
```

## Key Features Demonstrated

- **DNS Resolution**: Converting DNS addresses to IP addresses
- **Peer ID Preservation**: Maintaining peer IDs during resolution
- **Multiple Protocol Support**: /dns/, /dns4/, /dns6/, /dnsaddr/
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of resolution failures
- **Real Bootstrap Node Examples**: Using actual libp2p bootstrap nodes that resolve to IP addresses

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- py-multiaddr library
- trio library
- Internet connection for DNS resolution

## Usage

```bash
python trio_dns_examples.py
```

## Notes

- This script uses real bootstrap nodes from bootstrap.libp2p.io that actually resolve
- The DNS resolver requires trio for async operations
- Peer IDs are preserved during resolution for bootstrap node functionality
- All examples demonstrate working DNS resolution to actual IP addresses
